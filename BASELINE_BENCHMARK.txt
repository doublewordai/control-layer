=== Baseline Build Performance ===
Date: $(date)
Configuration: --no-default-features (no embedded-db)

Clean Build:
  Real time: 1m 28.410s (88.4 seconds)
  User time: 7m 38.230s (458 seconds)
  Sys time:  2m 9.130s (129 seconds)
  
Parallelization: 6.6x (458 user / 88.4 real)
Crates compiled: 370

Key findings:
- Build is well parallelized (6.6x speedup)
- Main bottlenecks are proc-macro heavy crates:
  * sqlx-macros
  * utoipa-gen  
  * bon-macros
  * Multiple tokio/serde derive macros
  
- Duplicate dependencies:
  * axum v0.7.9 and v0.8.6
  * axum-prometheus v0.8.0 and v0.9.0
  
- Heavy feature flags:
  * tokio features = ["full"]
